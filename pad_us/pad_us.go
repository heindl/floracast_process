	// Level of public access permitted. Open requires no special requirements for public access to the property (may include regular hours available); Restricted requires a special permit from the owner for access, a registration permit on public land or has highly variable times when open to use; Closed occurs where no public access allowed (land bank property, special ecological study areas, military bases, etc. Unknown is assigned where information is not currently available. Access is assigned categorically by Designation Type or provided by PAD-US State Data Stewards, federal or NGO partners. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator with available public access information
	Access  PublicAccess `json:"Access"`
	DAccess string       `json:"d_Access"`
	// Documents the Source of Access domain assignment (e.g. State Data Steward or ‘GAP Default’ categorical assignment).
	AccessSource string `json:"Access_Src"`
	// "Aggregator Source" identifies the organization credited with data aggregation, PAD-US publication and name of aggregated data set or file. Attributed in the format ‘organization name_PADUSversion_filename.filetype’ (e.g. TNC_PADUS1_4_SecuredAreas2008.shp). Use acronym or replace spaces with underscore. A data aggregator submits data in the PAD-US schema according to standards and/or aggregates regional or national datasets with required fields for PAD-US translation
	AggregatorSource    string `json:"Agg_Src"`
	// General category for the protection mechanism associated with the protected area. ‘Fee’ is the most common way real estate is owned. A conservation ‘easement’ creates a legally enforceable land preservation agreement between a landowner and government agency or qualified land protection organization (i.e. land trust). ‘Other’ types of protection include leases, agreements or those over marine waters. ‘Designation’ is applied to designations in the federal theme not tied to title documents (e.g. National Monument, Wild and Scenic River). These may be removed to reduce overlaps for area based analyses.
	Category  Category `json:"Category"`
	DCategory string `json:"d_Category"`
	// Comments from either the original data source or aggregator.
	Comments  string `json:"Comments"`
	// The Year (yyyy) the protected area was designated, decreed or otherwise established. Date is assigned to each unit by name, without event status(e.g. Yellowstone National Park: 1872, Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area: 1980)
	DateEst   string `json:"Date_Est"`
	// The unit’s land management description or designation, standardized for nation (e.g. Area of Critical Environmental Concern, Wilderness Area, State Park, Local Rec Area, Conservation Easement). See the PAD-US Data Standard for a crosswalk of "Designation Type" from source data files or the geodatabase look up table for "Designation Type" for domain descriptions. "Designation Type" supports PAD-US queries and categorical conservation measures or public access assignments in the absence of other information.

	// The most current Year (yyyy) the GAP Status Code was assigned to the polygon.
	GAPCdDt   string `json:"GAPCdDt"`
	// An acronym to describe the organization(s) that applied Gap Status Code to the polygon. This field also describes the methods used for assigning GAP Status as follows: ‘GAP – Default’ is assigned when GAP’s categorical assignment of status has been applied, without more detailed review or inquiry. ‘GAP’ is assigned when standard methods (management plan reviewed and/or land manager interviewed to assign GAP Status to a protected area) apply as provided above. ‘GAP – other organization’ (e.g. GAP – NPS) applies when the measure is assigned in partnership with GAP, including review. When another organization applied GAP Status according to their methods then ‘other organization’ (e.g. TNC) is assigned. See the PAD-US Standards Manual for more information.
	GapStatusCodeSource  string `json:"GAPCdSrc"`
	// The GAP Status Code is a measure of management intent to conserve biodiversity defined as: Status 1: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a natural state within which disturbance events (of natural type, frequency, intensity, and legacy) are allowed to proceed without interference or are mimicked through management. Status 2: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a primarily natural state, but which may receive uses or management practices that degrade the quality of existing natural communities, including suppression of natural disturbance. Status 3: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover for the majority of the area, but subject to extractive uses of either a broad, low-intensity type (e.g., logging, OHV recreation) or localized intense type (e.g., mining). It also confers protection to federally listed endangered and threatened species throughout the area. Status 4: There are no known public or private institutional mandates or legally recognized easements or deed restrictions held by the managing entity to prevent conversion of natural habitat types to anthropogenic habitat types. The area generally allows conversion to unnatural land cover throughout or management intent is unknown. See the PAD-US Standards Manual for a summary of methods or the geodatabase look up table for short descriptions.

	// The most current Year (yyyy) the IUCN Category was assigned to the polygon.
	IUCNCategoryDate  string `json:"IUCNCtDt"`
	// An acronym to describe the organization(s) that applied IUCN Category to the polygon. This field also describes the methods used for assigning IUCN Category as follows: ‘GAP – Default’ is assigned when GAP’s categorical assignment of status has been applied, without additional review. ‘GAP – other organization’ (e.g. GAP – NPS) applies when the measure is assigned in partnership with GAP, including review. When another organization applies IUCN Category according to their methods then ‘other organization’ (e.g. TNC) is assigned. See the PAD-US Standards Manual for more information.
	IUCNCategorySource string `json:"IUCNCtSrc"`
	// International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) management categories assigned to protected areas for inclusion in the UNEP- World Conservation Monitoring Center’s (WCMC) World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) and the Commission for Environmental Cooperation’s (CEC) North American Terrestrial Protected Areas Database. IUCN defines a protected area as, "A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values" (includes GAP Status Code 1 and 2 only). Categorization follows as: Category Ia: Strict Nature Reserves are strictly protected areas set aside to protect biodiversity and also possibly geological / geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and impacts are strictly controlled and limited to ensure preservation of the conservation values. Such protected areas can serve as indispensable reference areas for scientific research and monitoring. Category Ib: Wilderness Areas are protected areas are usually large unmodified or slightly modified areas, retaining their natural character and influence, without permanent or significant human habitation, which are protected and managed so as to preserve their natural condition. Category II: National Park protected areas are large natural or near natural areas set aside to protect large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species and ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities. Category III: Natural Monument or Feature protected areas are set aside to protect a specific natural monument, which can be a land form, sea mount, submarine caverns, geological feature such as caves or even a living feature such as an ancient grove. They are generally quite small protected areas and often have high visitor value. Category IV: Habitat/species management protected areas aim to protect particular species or habitats and management reflects this priority. Many category IV protected areas will need regular, active interventions to address the requirements of particular species or to maintain habitats, but this is not a requirement of this category. Category V: Protected landscape/seascape protected areas occur where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value. Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use (community based, non industrial) of natural resources are generally large, with much of the area in a more-or-less natural condition and whereas a proportion is under sustainable natural resource management and where such exploitation is seen as one of the main aims of the area. "Other Conservation Areas" are not recognized by IUCN at this time; however, they are included in the CEC’s database referenced above. These areas (includes GAP Status Code 3 only)are included in the IUCN Category Domain along with "Unassigned" areas (includes GAP Status Code 4) and "Not Reported" areas that meet the definition of IUCN protection (i.e. GAP Status Code 1 or 2) but where IUCN Category has not yet been assigned and categorical assignment is not appropriate. See the PAD-US Standards Manual for a summary of methods.
